# Teleporter

This is a 2D shooter platformer game I made for fun in Unity. Unlike most platformer games, the character can't jump, so you have to use key bindings to teleport to various platforms on the the screen. I implemented a layer-based collision system in this game and experimented with the built in Unity Physics2D physics system.

To run the game, download the "Teleporter" folder, and then run "Platformer.exe" in the "Teleporter_Build" folder.
